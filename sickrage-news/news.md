####2016-05-23 - Medusa v0.1.0 released####

## Welcome to **Medusa!**

We have worked really hard to bring you many improvement to our fork of SickRage/SickBeard.

First, and foremost, we've added a new manual search so you can select the search result you want (Voted *the most desired feature* by SickRage users!) 

In addition detection of release qualities has been greatly improved by adding additional tags and improving detection of previous tags.

Subtitle searches now work better than ever with the new refiners which ensure higher quality matches, even if the file has already been renamed and added to your library.

Also, don't forget to check out our new Preferred and Undesired word lists which complement the existing Required and Ignored lists!
