## 0.1.4 released!

Another release with a lot of fixes and some new features. The most noticeable change in this release is the improved 'Recommended Shows' page, which now features three options to add your favorite shows: IMDB's popular shows, Trakt lists and for the anime watchers among us, the brand new Anidb's hot anime list. This release consists mainly of under-the-hood changes, as always check out the changelog for more information. We hope you enjoy our efforts!

## 0.1.3 is finally here!

After nearly a month of hard work, the Medusa team is proud to bring you the biggest release to date, featuring many new features, bug fixes and improvements. The highlight of this release is without doubt the significant improvement made to the name parser. Thanks to [guessit](https://github.com/guessit-io/guessit) we now have a more accurate release name detection and a much more efficient proper detection. Show pages are now enriched with beautiful posters and contain more information about the amount of episodes present for each season, including their total size. Many providers have been fixed, some were added and a bunch were improved. Please have a look at the full changelog for more detailed information. We would like to thank everyone for the amazing support in the past few months and wish all of you relaxing summer holidays!

## Welcome to **Medusa**!

We have worked really hard to bring you many improvement to our fork of SickRage/SickBeard.

First and foremost, we've added a new manual search so you can select the search result you want (Voted **the most desired feature** by SickRage users!) 

In addition, detection of release qualities has been greatly improved by adding additional tags and improving detection of previous tags.

Subtitle searches now work better than ever with the new refiners which ensure higher quality matches, even if the file has already been renamed and added to your library.

Also, don't forget to check out our new Preferred and Undesired word lists which complement the existing Required and Ignored lists!
